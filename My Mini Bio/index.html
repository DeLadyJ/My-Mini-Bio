            <h1>My Mini Bio</h1>

            <p>I live in Boston. Specifically in Dorchester. I've lived most of my life in Dorchester. Most of my work experience has been in the medical field. I'm looking to transition to the technical field. Specifically I'm looking to get a job as a Web Developer. I know my skills and previous work experience will help me obtain a position as a Web Developer. Some of the activities that I like to do are knitting, doing puzzles - both picture and word, and also playing cards. One of my favorite colors is <span style="color:red"><b>RED</b></span>.</p>
